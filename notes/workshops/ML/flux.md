Implement it just in julia

Machine learning:

input &rarr; unknown process &rarr; output

input &rarr; differentiable program &rarr; output

start random and train (need a way to evaluate - loss function)

We used to write these gradients, now automatic differentiation.

SGD algorithm, parameters, data and loss function.

Only visually deep, not conceptually deep.
